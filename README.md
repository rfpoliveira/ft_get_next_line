About:

get_next_line is an interesting project to explore static variable and file descriptors while diving deeper into memory allocation.
It consists in reading 1 line in a text file and printing it in the terminal and subsequent calls of the function in the same file return the next line.
The bonus consists in the program working if you call different file descriptors in the same execution reading from different files but remembering the position in all of them.

Usage:

Clone and make for the mandatory part.
For bonus simply make inside the bonus directory.
